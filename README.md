Social Network analysis on Twitter and Facebook data.

## Work

**Twitter:**

- Sentiment Analysis of tweets and word clouds to present them.
- Plotting the tweets on a graph with color corresponding to the sentiment for any particular user to see how the user's following or people viewing that user's tweet reacted to the tweets, giving us an idea about the community.

**Facebook:**

- Plotting demographic information.
- Creating edge-node graphs for different ages to see patterns in _number of friends_, _tenure_ and _likes-recieved_ according to user's age and gender.
